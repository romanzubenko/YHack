Currently, big data is underutilized in personal education, more directly, in the study of language. There has been an upsurge in language software such as Pimsleur and Rosette Stone but all these approaches follow old standards. We have developed a system to teach custom tailored linguistic skills based on Bing and Facebook big data by analyzing personal speech patterns and creating a visual platform on which your personal language tendencies are graphed and translated.
